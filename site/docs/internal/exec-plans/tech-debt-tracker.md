# Tech Debt Tracker

Keep this list short. Each item must describe current behavior, name a concrete
owner path, and explain the user or release impact. Completed history belongs in
the relevant exec plan, not in this file.

## Product paths

- **AgentBoard has no mobile column reflow.** Owner:
  `web/src/features/lumilio/flows/board/AgentBoard.tsx`. It renders one
  persisted 12-column layout at every width, so phone columns compress into
  narrow slivers. Add a client-only narrow-screen remap or a separately
  persisted breakpoint layout, then verify it against a live backend without
  corrupting the canonical desktop layout.
