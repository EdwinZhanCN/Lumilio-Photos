# Lumen

Lumen, it is the Machine Learning Module for Lumilio Photos, which is the core of this intelligent media manage center.

Imagine if the Machine Learning Module for Lumilio Photos had to clock in at the office every day, just like the employees in Severance. On the outside, it's a powerful, robust ML tool; on the inside, it's just trying to figure out what a "waffle party" is and why it keeps getting asked to sort photos of goats.
